# successive-prime-numbers
Python: 
The code lays out successive prime numbers one after the other and spits out the n-th to (n+5)th position substring 
where n is the input to the program.

- Here the code optimization is done by using the past genrated prime numbers and then use only those in the prime check (upto the the sqrt).
- Also the while loop is always skipped by 1 (Even number) number. (i.e i+=2)
